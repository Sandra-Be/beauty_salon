# Testing

* Tested on Chrome and Firefox desktop version browsers.
* Chrome DevTools was used to test variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8, Galaxy S5 and iPad for responsiveness.
* Testing was done to ensure that layout and all Links were working correctly.

## W3C Validation

To validate every page of the project, that there were no syntax errors, these two Validators were used, W3C Validator and W3C CSS Validator. Files of .pdf format is available under each Validator link:

* [W3C Validator](assets/project_files/validators/w3c_validation.pdf)
* [W3C CSS Validator](assets/project_files/validators/w3c_css_validation.pdf)

## Bugs and Issues

**W3C Validator**

These warnings repeat throughout all html files.

* *Warning:* The document is not mappable to XML 1.0 due to two consecutive hyphens in a comment.

Warning was fixed by removing the consecutive hyphens.

* *Warning:* Section lacks heading. Consider using h2 - h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections.

Section contains only images.

**W3C CSS Validator**

* 273 -> **-webkit-transition** is an unknown vendor extension
* 274 -> **-o-transition** is an unknown vendor extension
* 287 -> **-moz-transition** is an unknown vendor extension
* 288 -> **-webkit-transition** is an unknown vendor extension
* 289 -> **-o-transition** is an unknown vendor extension 

All these extensions are removed. The icons has hover attribute and icons change colour when hovered over. There is no need for these extensions in the code.

* 576 .btn:hover -> Same color for **background-color** and **border-color** 

When hovering over the button it turns completely red. The attribute is there for a reason. 

## User stories testing

Each User story is tested throughout the website.

   > 1. As a new client to this website, I want to find information that is quick and easy to navigate through the website, so that I can find what I need.

The Navigation bar is implemented into the website, so that any new client is able to find any information quick and easy.

This Navigation bar is implemented on the desktop, laptop and tablet:

![Navigation bar](assets/project_files/website/user_story1.png "Navigation bar")

This Navigation bar is implemented on mobile view:

![Navigation bar](assets/project_files/website/user_story12.png "Navigation bar")


   > 2. As a new client to this website, I want to get a quality of the procedures that are done, so I can trust in the service provided.

The Gallery page shows quality images of procedures and descriptions, so that any new client can see for themselves and make a decision.

![Gallery](assets/project_files/website/user_story2.png "Gallery")


   > 3. As a new client to this website, I want to learn more about the beautician, so I can feel a connection with that person.

The Home page reviews the beauticians profile picture, so that any new client can see a real person behind this service and can connect.

![Home page](assets/project_files/website/user_story3.png "Home page")


   > 4. As a new client, I want to view a price list for the procedures, so I can decide if I want to proceed with that.

The Pricing page reviews a table with prices and detailed descriptions about the procedures, also on the bottom of the page any client has access to download "Price List" file for any device. From this any new client can decide if they want to proceed.

![Price List](assets/project_files/website/user_story4.png "Price List")


   > 5. As a new client, I want to know how to contact the beautician, so I know how to enquire about the information.

The Contact Me page represents a contact form where any new client can enquire any information from the beautician. Filling out the form and proceeding with Send Message button will generate a report with a thank you message and that beautician will be in contact with the client as soon as possible. Unfortunately with my level of knowledge at this moment the message won't be sent to an actual beautician, but this will be implemented in the future.

![Contact Form](assets/project_files/website/user_story5.png "Contact Form")


   > 6. As a client, I want to follow the salon media feed, so I can be up to date with the latest information.

On each webpage Footer section any client can find a link to social media and by clicking on it the client will be redirected to the beauticians social media feed, so any client can follow up with the latest information.
